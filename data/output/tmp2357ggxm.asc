This netlist describes a simple DC circuit drawn in a schematic-capture tool (such as those used for SPICE simulation). Let’s break down what the netlist is showing and then analyze the circuit.

Circuit Description:
──────────────────────────────
• The file starts with “Version 4” and “SHEET 1 880 680” indicating the document version and sheet size.

• There is a voltage source symbol placed at coordinates (48,112):
  – It is labeled as V1 with a value of 20 volts.
   SYMATTR InstName V1
   SYMATTR Value 20

• There are three resistor symbols:
  1. Resistor R1 at (128,112) with a value of 5 Ω.
   SYMATTR InstName R1
   SYMATTR Value 5
  2. Resistor R2 at (208,112) with a value of 5 Ω.
   SYMATTR InstName R2
   SYMATTR Value 5
  3. Resistor R3 at (288,112) with a value of 5 Ω.
   SYMATTR InstName R3
   SYMATTR Value 5

• The wires connect the components in sequence:
  – The voltage source’s positive node (at 48,112) is connected via a wire to the left terminal of R1.
  – R1 is connected to R2, and then R2 is connected to R3.
  – After R3, the wiring continues via additional wires to form the return loop:
   – There is a wire from (328,112) vertically down to (328,160), then horizontally to (48,160),
    and finally vertically up from (48,160) to (48,112) (closing the loop).
  – A “FLAG” is placed at (48,160) with the value “0” indicating that node is at 0 V (ground).

Circuit Analysis:
──────────────────────────────
Since the three resistors are connected in series with the voltage source, the analysis is straightforward:

1. Total resistance (R_total):
  R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 = 5 Ω + 5 Ω + 5 Ω = 15 Ω

2. Circuit current (I):
  Using Ohm’s law, I = V / R_total = 20 V / 15 Ω ≈ 1.33 A

3. Voltage drop across each resistor:
  Each resistor drops V = I × R = 1.33 A × 5 Ω ≈ 6.67 V

Thus, the 20 V provided by the source is divided almost equally (approximately 6.67 V each) among the three resistors, with the leftover rounding error due to the approximated current.

Summary:
──────────────────────────────
• The netlist represents a series circuit with a 20 V source and three 5 Ω resistors.
• The total series resistance is 15 Ω.
• The computed current through the circuit is about 1.33 A.
• Each resistor drops roughly 6.67 V.

If you run this netlist in a SPICE simulation tool, you would see these calculated values in the DC analysis.
