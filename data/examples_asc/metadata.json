Instructions for Updating the Circuit Examples Database:

This JSON file contains an array of example entries for circuit designs.
Each entry should include:

1. "asc_path": The relative path to the .asc file (located in data/examples_asc/).
2. "description": A concise description of the circuit, highlighting key components 
and the overall functionality. This description is used to generate embeddings for semantic search.

Example entry:
{
    "asc_path": "data/examples_asc/2parallel.asc",
    "description": "Two resistors in parallel, each 2 ohms, with a DC source of 5V."
}

Guidelines:
- Ensure that the .asc file is placed inside the 'data/examples_asc/' folder.
- Write clear, distinctive descriptions for each circuit. Aim to cover a range of circuit types 
(e.g., filters, amplifiers, oscillators).
- For a minimal starting set, curate around 20 distinctive examples. Our retrieval system will return the single best match for each query.
- When adding a new example, check for duplicates and ensure that the new entry provides unique value.
- After updating the JSON file, run the ingestion script (if applicable) to update the vector database with the new examples.

By following these instructions, we ensure our vector database remains effective for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) of new circuit designs.
